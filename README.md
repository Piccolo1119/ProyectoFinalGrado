# ElectricHalen 🎸🎶

ElectricHalen is a web application I developed for my final project in the web application development course.

This web platform is designed for buying and selling musical instruments, specifically guitars and basses. Users can log in with a username and password to trade their own products and those of other members of the site.

## Key Features ✨

- **Catalog of second-hand instruments** with detailed information. 🛒
- **Specific information** for guitars and basses, categorized separately. 🎸🎸
- **User login and registration** functionality. Once registered, users can:
  - List, edit, or delete their own instruments. ✍️
  - View their orders. 📦
- **Ability to log out** and log in as other users to browse instruments listed by others. 🔑
- **Logged-in users cannot view their own listed instruments.** 👀
- **Logged-in users can purchase instruments** listed by others by placing an order, which removes the instrument from the platform. They can also publish new instruments for sale. 🛍️
- The application stores **all registered users** and their interactions with the platform, ensuring that users are connected to their published products, edited or deleted products, and the instruments they have purchased. 🔄

## Installation 🚀

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
